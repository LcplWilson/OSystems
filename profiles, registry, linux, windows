Using the Registry

    Outcome: The "Using the Registry" section covers the practical uses of the Windows Registry for both offensive and defensive purposes. Cover that any changes are only used if the process reads the new value from the registry. Cover the registries most commonly used for persistence. Cover the registries most commonly used for forensics.

Registry Changes

    Often require restart

        Either entire system or just a program

    Some changes take effect immediately

    Some parts of registry are always in memory

Registry locations that can be utilized for persistence

    HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

    HKU\<SID>\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

    HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services

Baselining the Registry

    Determining if the registry has been compromised

        Suspicious behavior

        Potenially malicious application removed from file system, but traces of application keep appearing

    Importance of baselining

Value 	Universal well-known SID 	Identifies
S-1-0-0 	Null SID 	A group with no members. This is often used when a SID value isn't known.
S-1-1-0 	World 	A group that includes all users.
S-1-2-0 	Local 	Users who sign in to terminals that are locally (physically) connected to the system.
S-1-2-1 	Console Logon 	A group that includes users who are signed in to the physical console.
S-1-3-0 	Creator Owner ID 	A security identifier to be replaced by the security identifier of the user who created a new object. This SID is used in inheritable access control entries (ACEs).
S-1-3-1 	Creator Group ID 	A security identifier to be replaced by the primary-group SID of the user who created a new object. Use this SID in inheritable ACEs.
S-1-3-2 	Owner Server 	A placeholder in an inheritable ACE. When the ACE is inherited, the system replaces this SID with the SID for the object's owner server and stores information about who created a given object or file.
S-1-3-3 	Group Server 	A placeholder in an inheritable ACE. When the ACE is inherited, the system replaces this SID with the SID for the object's group server and stores information about the groups that are allowed to work with the object.
S-1-3-4 	Owner Rights 	A group that represents the current owner of the object. When an ACE that carries this SID is applied to an object, the system ignores the implicit READ_CONTROL and WRITE_DAC permissions for the object owner.
S-1-4 	Non-unique Authority 	A SID that represents an identifier authority.
S-1-5 	NT Authority 	A SID that represents an identifier authority.
S-1-5-80-0 	All Services 	A group that includes all service processes configured on the system. Membership is controlled by the operating system.
Identifier authority 	Value 	SID string prefix
SECURITY_NULL_SID_AUTHORITY 	0 	S-1-0
SECURITY_WORLD_SID_AUTHORITY 	1 	S-1-1
SECURITY_LOCAL_SID_AUTHORITY 	2 	S-1-2
SECURITY_CREATOR_SID_AUTHORITY 	3 	S-1-3
SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY 	5 	S-1-5
SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_AUTHORITY 	18 	S-1-18
Relative identifier authority 	Value 	Identifier authority
SECURITY_NULL_RID 	0 	S-1-0
SECURITY_WORLD_RID 	0 	S-1-1
SECURITY_LOCAL_RID 	0 	S-1-2
SECURITY_CREATOR_OWNER_RID 	0 	S-1-3
SECURITY_CREATOR_GROUP_RID 	1 	S-1-3
SID 	Display name 	Description
S-1-5-1 	Dialup 	A group that includes all users who are signed in to the system via dial-up connection.
S-1-5-113 	Local account 	You can use this SID when you're restricting network sign-in to local accounts instead of "administrator" or equivalent. This SID can be effective in blocking network sign-in for local users and groups by account type regardless of what they're named.
S-1-5-114 	Local account and member of Administrators group 	You can use this SID when you're restricting network sign-in to local accounts instead of "administrator" or equivalent. This SID can be effective in blocking network sign-in for local users and groups by account type regardless of what they're named.
S-1-5-2 	Network 	A group that includes all users who are signed in via a network connection. Access tokens for interactive users don't contain the Network SID.
S-1-5-3 	Batch 	A group that includes all users who have signed in via batch queue facility, such as task scheduler jobs.
S-1-5-4 	Interactive 	A group that includes all users who sign in interactively. A user can start an interactive sign-in session by opening a Remote Desktop Services connection from a remote computer, or by using a remote shell such as Telnet. In each case, the user's access token contains the Interactive SID. If the user signs in by using a Remote Desktop Services connection, the user's access token also contains the Remote Interactive Logon SID.
S-1-5-5- X-Y 	Logon Session 	The X and Y values for these SIDs uniquely identify a particular sign-in session.
S-1-5-6 	Service 	A group that includes all security principals that have signed in as a service.
S-1-5-7 	Anonymous Logon 	A user who has connected to the computer without supplying a user name and password.
The Anonymous Logon identity is different from the identity that's used by Internet Information Services (IIS) for anonymous web access. IIS uses an actual account—by default, IUSR_ComputerName, for anonymous access to resources on a website. Strictly speaking, such access isn't anonymous, because the security principal is known even though unidentified people are using the account. IUSR_ComputerName (or whatever you name the account) has a password, and IIS signs in to the account when the service starts. As a result, the IIS "anonymous" user is a member of Authenticated Users but Anonymous Logon isn't.
S-1-5-8 	Proxy 	Doesn't currently apply: this SID isn't used.
S-1-5-9 	Enterprise Domain Controllers 	A group that includes all domain controllers in a forest of domains.
S-1-5-10 	Self 	A placeholder in an ACE for a user, group, or computer object in Active Directory. When you grant permissions to Self, you grant them to the security principal that's represented by the object. During an access check, the operating system replaces the SID for Self with the SID for the security principal that's represented by the object.
S-1-5-11 	Authenticated Users 	A group that includes all users and computers with identities that have been authenticated. Authenticated Users doesn't include Guest even if the Guest account has a password.
This group includes authenticated security principals from any trusted domain, not only the current domain.
S-1-5-12 	Restricted Code 	An identity that's used by a process that's running in a restricted security context. In Windows and Windows Server operating systems, a software restriction policy can assign one of three security levels to code:
Unrestricted
Restricted
Disallowed
When code runs at the restricted security level, the Restricted SID is added to the user's access token.
S-1-5-13 	Terminal Server User 	A group that includes all users who sign in to a server with Remote Desktop Services enabled.
S-1-5-14 	Remote Interactive Logon 	A group that includes all users who sign in to the computer by using a remote desktop connection. This group is a subset of the Interactive group. Access tokens that contain the Remote Interactive Logon SID also contain the Interactive SID.
S-1-5-15 	This Organization 	A group that includes all users from the same organization. Included only with Active Directory accounts and added only by a domain controller.
S-1-5-17 	IUSR 	An account that's used by the default Internet Information Services (IIS) user.
S-1-5-18 	System (or LocalSystem) 	An identity that's used locally by the operating system and by services that are configured to sign in as LocalSystem.
System is a hidden member of Administrators. That is, any process running as System has the SID for the built-in Administrators group in its access token.
When a process that's running locally as System accesses network resources, it does so by using the computer's domain identity. Its access token on the remote computer includes the SID for the local computer's domain account plus SIDs for security groups that the computer is a member of, such as Domain Computers and Authenticated Users.
S-1-5-19 	NT Authority (LocalService) 	An identity that's used by services that are local to the computer, have no need for extensive local access, and don't need authenticated network access. Services that run as LocalService access local resources as ordinary users, and they access network resources as anonymous users. As a result, a service that runs as LocalService has significantly less authority than a service that runs as LocalSystem locally and on the network.
S-1-5-20 	Network Service 	An identity that's used by services that have no need for extensive local access but do need authenticated network access. Services running as NetworkService access local resources as ordinary users and access network resources by using the computer's identity. As a result, a service that runs as NetworkService has the same network access as a service that runs as LocalSystem, but it has significantly reduced local access.
S-1-5-domain-500 	Administrator 	A user account for the system administrator. Every computer has a local Administrator account and every domain has a domain Administrator account.
The Administrator account is the first account created during operating system installation. The account can't be deleted, disabled, or locked out, but it can be renamed.
By default, the Administrator account is a member of the Administrators group, and it can't be removed from that group.
S-1-5-domain-501 	Guest 	A user account for people who don't have individual accounts. Every computer has a local Guest account, and every domain has a domain Guest account.
By default, Guest is a member of the Everyone and the Guests groups. The domain Guest account is also a member of the Domain Guests and Domain Users groups.
Unlike Anonymous Logon, Guest is a real account, and it can be used to sign in interactively. The Guest account doesn't require a password, but it can have one.
S-1-5-domain-502 	KRBTGT 	A user account that's used by the Key Distribution Center (KDC) service. The account exists only on domain controllers.
S-1-5-domain-512 	Domain Admins 	A global group with members that are authorized to administer the domain. By default, the Domain Admins group is a member of the Administrators group on all computers that have joined the domain, including domain controllers.
Domain Admins is the default owner of any object that's created in the domain's Active Directory by any member of the group. If members of the group create other objects, such as files, the default owner is the Administrators group.
S-1-5-domain-513 	Domain Users 	A global group that includes all users in a domain. When you create a new User object in Active Directory, the user is automatically added to this group.
S-1-5-domain-514 	Domain Guests 	A global group that, by default, has only one member: the domain's built-in Guest account.
S-1-5-domain-515 	Domain Computers 	A global group that includes all computers that have joined the domain, excluding domain controllers.
S-1-5-domain-516 	Domain Controllers 	A global group that includes all domain controllers in the domain. New domain controllers are added to this group automatically.
S-1-5-domain-517 	Cert Publishers 	A global group that includes all computers that host an enterprise certification authority.
Cert Publishers are authorized to publish certificates for User objects in Active Directory.
S-1-5-root domain-518 	Schema Admins 	A group that exists only in the forest root domain. It's a universal group if the domain is in native mode, and it's a global group if the domain is in mixed mode. The Schema Admins group is authorized to make schema changes in Active Directory. By default, the only member of the group is the Administrator account for the forest root domain.
S-1-5-root domain-519 	Enterprise Admins 	A group that exists only in the forest root domain. It's a universal group if the domain is in native mode, and it's a global group if the domain is in mixed mode.
The Enterprise Admins group is authorized to make changes to the forest infrastructure, such as adding child domains, configuring sites, authorizing DHCP servers, and installing enterprise certification authorities.
By default, the only member of Enterprise Admins is the Administrator account for the forest root domain. The group is a default member of every Domain Admins group in the forest.
S-1-5-domain-520 	Group Policy Creator Owners 	A global group that's authorized to create new Group Policy Objects in Active Directory. By default, the only member of the group is Administrator.
Objects that are created by members of Group Policy Creator Owners are owned by the individual user who creates them. In this way, the Group Policy Creator Owners group is unlike other administrative groups (such as Administrators and Domain Admins). Objects that are created by members of these groups are owned by the group rather than by the individual.
S-1-5-domain-521 	Read-only Domain Controllers 	A global group that includes all read-only domain controllers.
S-1-5-domain-522 	Clonable Controllers 	A global group that includes all domain controllers in the domain that can be cloned.
S-1-5-domain-525 	Protected Users 	A global group that is afforded additional protections against authentication security threats.
S-1-5-root domain-526 	Key Admins 	This group is intended for use in scenarios where trusted external authorities are responsible for modifying this attribute. Only trusted administrators should be made a member of this group.
S-1-5-domain-527 	Enterprise Key Admins 	This group is intended for use in scenarios where trusted external authorities are responsible for modifying this attribute. Only trusted enterprise administrators should be made a member of this group.
S-1-5-32-544 	Administrators 	A built-in group. After the initial installation of the operating system, the only member of the group is the Administrator account. When a computer joins a domain, the Domain Admins group is added to the Administrators group. When a server becomes a domain controller, the Enterprise Admins group also is added to the Administrators group.
S-1-5-32-545 	Users 	A built-in group. After the initial installation of the operating system, the only member is the Authenticated Users group.
S-1-5-32-546 	Guests 	A built-in group. By default, the only member is the Guest account. The Guests group allows occasional or one-time users to sign in with limited privileges to a computer's built-in Guest account.
S-1-5-32-547 	Power Users 	A built-in group. By default, the group has no members. Power users can create local users and groups; modify and delete accounts that they have created; and remove users from the Power Users, Users, and Guests groups. Power users also can install programs; create, manage, and delete local printers; and create and delete file shares.
S-1-5-32-548 	Account Operators 	A built-in group that exists only on domain controllers. By default, the group has no members. By default, Account Operators have permission to create, modify, and delete accounts for users, groups, and computers in all containers and organizational units of Active Directory except the Builtin container and the Domain Controllers OU. Account Operators don't have permission to modify the Administrators and Domain Admins groups, nor do they have permission to modify the accounts for members of those groups.
S-1-5-32-549 	Server Operators 	Description: A built-in group that exists only on domain controllers. By default, the group has no members. Server Operators can sign in to a server interactively; create and delete network shares; start and stop services; back up and restore files; format the hard disk of the computer; and shut down the computer.
S-1-5-32-550 	Print Operators 	A built-in group that exists only on domain controllers. By default, the only member is the Domain Users group. Print Operators can manage printers and document queues.
S-1-5-32-551 	Backup Operators 	A built-in group. By default, the group has no members. Backup Operators can back up and restore all files on a computer, regardless of the permissions that protect those files. Backup Operators also can sign in to the computer and shut it down.
S-1-5-32-552 	Replicators 	A built-in group that's used by the File Replication service on domain controllers. By default, the group has no members. Don't add users to this group.
S-1-5-domain-553 	RAS and IAS Servers 	A local domain group. By default, this group has no members. Computers that are running the Routing and Remote Access service are added to the group automatically.
Members of this group have access to certain properties of User objects, such as Read Account Restrictions, Read Logon Information, and Read Remote Access Information.
S-1-5-32-554 	Builtin\Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access 	An alias added by Windows 2000. A backward compatibility group that allows read access on all users and groups in the domain.

Registry hive 	Supporting files
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM 	Sam, Sam.log, Sam.sav
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security 	Security, Security.log, Security.sav
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software 	Software, Software.log, Software.sav
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System 	System, System.alt, System.log, System.sav
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG 	System, System.alt, System.log, System.sav, Ntuser.dat, Ntuser.dat.log
HKEY_USERS\DEFAULT 	Default, Default.log, Default.sav
HKEY_CURRENT_USER 	Contains the root of the configuration information for the user who is currently logged on. The user's folders, screen colors, and Control Panel settings are stored here. This information is associated with the user's profile. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCU.
HKEY_USERS 	Contains all the actively loaded user profiles on the computer. HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a subkey of HKEY_USERS. HKEY_USERS is sometimes abbreviated as HKU.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE 	Contains configuration information particular to the computer (for any user). This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKLM.
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT 	Is a subkey of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software. The information that is stored here makes sure that the correct program opens when you open a file by using Windows Explorer. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCR. Starting with Windows 2000, this information is stored under both the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys. The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes key contains default settings that can apply to all users on the local computer. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes key contains settings that override the default settings and apply only to the interactive user. The HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key provides a view of the registry that merges the information from these two sources. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT also provides this merged view for programs that are designed for earlier versions of Windows. To change the settings for the interactive user, changes must be made under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes instead of under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. To change the default settings, changes must be made under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes. If you write keys to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, the system stores the information under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes. If you write values to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and the key already exists under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes, the system will store the information there instead of under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes.
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG 	Contains information about the hardware profile that is used by the local computer at system startup.
Name 	Data type 	Description
Binary Value 	REG_BINARY 	Raw binary data. Most hardware component information is stored as binary data and is displayed in Registry Editor in hexadecimal format.
DWORD Value 	REG_DWORD 	Data represented by a number that is 4 bytes long (a 32-bit integer). Many parameters for device drivers and services are this type and are displayed in Registry Editor in binary, hexadecimal, or decimal format. Related values are DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN (least significant byte is at the lowest address) and REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN (least significant byte is at the highest address).
Expandable String Value 	REG_EXPAND_SZ 	A variable-length data string. This data type includes variables that are resolved when a program or service uses the data.
Multi-String Value 	REG_MULTI_SZ 	A multiple string. Values that contain lists or multiple values in a form that people can read are generally this type. Entries are separated by spaces, commas, or other marks.
String Value 	REG_SZ 	A fixed-length text string.
Binary Value 	REG_RESOURCE_LIST 	A series of nested arrays that is designed to store a resource list that is used by a hardware device driver or one of the physical devices it controls. This data is detected and written in the \ResourceMap tree by the system and is displayed in Registry Editor in hexadecimal format as a Binary Value.
Binary Value 	REG_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_LIST 	A series of nested arrays that is designed to store a device driver's list of possible hardware resources the driver or one of the physical devices it controls can use. The system writes a subset of this list in the \ResourceMap tree. This data is detected by the system and is displayed in Registry Editor in hexadecimal format as a Binary Value.
Binary Value 	REG_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR 	A series of nested arrays that is designed to store a resource list that is used by a physical hardware device. This data is detected and written in the \HardwareDescription tree by the system and is displayed in Registry Editor in hexadecimal format as a Binary Value.
None 	REG_NONE 	Data without any particular type. This data is written to the registry by the system or applications and is displayed in Registry Editor in hexadecimal format as a Binary Value
Link 	REG_LINK 	A Unicode string naming a symbolic link.
QWORD Value 	REG_QWORD 	Data represented by a number that is a 64-bit integer. This data is displayed in Registry Editor as a Binary Value and was introduced in Windows 2000.
    Get-Item – get a registry key
    New-Item — create a new registry key
    Remove-Item – delete a registry key
    Get-ItemProperty – get the value of a registry parameter
    Set-ItemProperty – change the value of a registry parameter
    New-ItemProperty – create registry parameter
    Rename-ItemProperty – rename parameter
    Remove-ItemProperty — remove registry parameter

Get-Item –Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DriverSearching
To get the value of a registry key parameter, use the Get-ItemProperty cmdlet.

$DriverUpdate = Get-ItemProperty –Path ‘HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DriverSearching’
$DriverUpdate.SearchOrderConfig
Changing Registry Value with PowerShell

To change the value of the SearchOrderConfig reg parameter, use the Set-ItemProperty cmdlet:

Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DriverSearching' -Name SearchOrderConfig -Value 0

Make sure that the parameter value has changed:

Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DriverSearching' -Name SearchOrderConfig

How to Create a New Register Key or Parameter with PowerShell?

To create a new registry key, use the New-Item command. Let’s create a new key with the name NewKey:

$HKCU_Desktop= "HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop"
New-Item –Path $HKCU_Desktop –Name NewKey

Now let’s create a new parameter in a new registry key. Suppose we need to create a new string parameter of type REG_SZ named SuperParamString and value filetmp1.txt:

New-ItemProperty -Path $HKCU_Desktop\NewKey -Name "SuperParamString" -Value ”filetmp1.txt”  -PropertyType "String"

If you need to check if a specific registry key exists, use the Test-Path cmdlet:

Test-Path 'HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop\NewKey'

The following PowerShell script will check if a specific registry value exists, and if not, create it.

regkey='HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop\NewKey'
$regparam='testparameter'
if (Get-ItemProperty -Path $regkey -Name $regparam -ErrorAction Ignore)
{ write-host 'The registry entry already exist' }
else
{ New-ItemProperty -Path $regkey -Name $regparam -Value ”woshub_test”  -PropertyType "String"  }

Using the Copy-Item cmdlet, you can copy entries from one registry key to another:

$source='HKLM:\SOFTWARE\7-zip\'
$dest = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\backup'
Copy-Item -Path $source -Destination $dest -Recurse

If you want to copy everything, including subkeys, add the –Recurse switch.
Deleting a Registry Key or Parameter

The Remove-ItemProperty command is used to remove a parameter in the registry key. Let’s remove the parameter SuperParamString created earlier:

$HKCU_Desktop= "HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop"
Remove-ItemProperty –Path $HKCU_Desktop\NewKey –Name "SuperParamString"

You can delete the entire registry key with all its contents:

Remove-Item –Path $HKCU_Desktop\NewKey –Recurse

To remove all items in the reg key (but not the key itself):

Remove-Item –Path $HKCU_Desktop\NewKey\* –Recurse
How to Rename a Registry Key or a Parameter?

You can rename the registry parameter with the command:

Rename-ItemProperty –path ‘HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop\NewKey’ –name "SuperParamString" –newname “OldParamString”

In the same way, you can rename the registry key:

Rename-Item -path 'HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop\NewKey' OldKey
Search Registry for Keyword Using PowerShell

PowerShell allows you to search the registry. The next following searches the HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop for parameters, whose names contain the *dpi* key.

$Path = (Get-ItemProperty ‘HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop’)
$Path.PSObject.Properties | ForEach-Object {
If($_.Name -like '*dpi*'){
Write-Host $_.Name ' = ' $_.Value
}
}

To find a registry key with a specific name:

Get-ChildItem -path HKLM:\ -recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*woshub*"}

n the following example, we will modify the ACL in this registry key to grant write access to the built-in Users group.

Get current permissions:

$rights = Get-Acl -Path 'HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop\NewKey'

Specify the user or group you want to grant access to:

$idRef = [System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]"BuiltIn\Users"

Select access level:

$regRights = [System.Security.AccessControl.RegistryRights]::WriteKey
Set permissions inheritance settings :

$inhFlags = [System.Security.AccessControl.InheritanceFlags]::None
$prFlags = [System.Security.AccessControl.PropagationFlags]::None

Access type (Allow/Deny):

$acType = [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType]::Allow
Create an access rule:

$rule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.RegistryAccessRule ($idRef, $regRights, $inhFlags, $prFlags, $acType)

Add a new rule to the current ACL:

$rights.AddAccessRule($rule)

Apply new permissions to the registry key:

$rights | Set-Acl -Path 'HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop\NewKey'

Getting a Registry Value from a Remote Computer via PowerShell

PowerShell allows you to access the registry of a remote computer. You can connect to a remote computer either using WinRM (Invoke-Command or Enter-PSSession). To get the value of a registry parameter from a remote computer:

Invoke-Command –ComputerName srv-fs1 –ScriptBlock {Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\System\Setup' -Name WorkingDirectory}

Or using a remote registry connection (the RemoteRegistry service must be enabled)

$Server = "lon-fs1"
$Reg = [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey]::OpenRemoteBaseKey('LocalMachine', $Server)
$RegKey= $Reg.OpenSubKey("System\Setup")
$RegValue = $RegKey.GetValue("WorkingDirectory")

question 1
Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated, 
for commands that will take multiple arguements. For the below examples, the first example is equivalent to the second command.

$ mkdir /var/log/{auth,syslog,dmesg}_log

Results in

$ mkdir /var/log/auth_log /var/log/syslog_log /var/log/dmesg_log

Activity: Using Brace-Expansion, create the following directories within the $HOME directory:

    1123
    1134
    1145
    1156

To read more on Brace Expansion, go to the following resource:

    https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Brace-Expansion

ANSWER:
mkdir $HOME/{1123,1134,1145,1156}



Question 2
As we learned, the following example would create five files with one command.

touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt passwd.txt shadow.txt

But, with Brace Expansion it can be shortened to the following.

touch file{1..3}.txt passwd.txt shadow.txt

Activity:

Use Brace-Expansion to create the following files within the $HOME/1123 directory. You may need to create the $HOME/1123 directory. Make the following files, but utilze Brace Expansion to make all nine files with one touch command.

Files to create:

    1.txt
    2.txt
    3.txt
    4.txt
    5.txt
    6~.txt
    7~.txt
    8~.txt
    9~.txt

ANSWER:
mkdir $HOME/1123
touch $HOME/1123/{1..5}.txt
touch $HOME/1123/{6..9}~.txt



Question 3 
Using the find command, list all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt.

Be aware that if you use Pattern Matching to locate the files you may have unintended results based on if you use quotes around the pattern or not. If you do not quote the pattern, the Bash shell interprets the pattern. If you quote the pattern, it is passed to the command for it to interpret. You can have a properly functioning command, yet unintended output, based on which of these two gets to interpret the pattern.

To read more on Pattern Matching, go to the following resource:

    https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Pattern-Matching

To read more on Quoting, go to the following resource:

    https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Quoting

ANSWER:
find $HOME/1123 -name *.txt

Question 4:
List all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt. Omit the files containing a tilde (~) character.

While this activity can be accomplished with only find, it can also be combined with grep as well.

Anwser:
find $HOME/1123 -name *.txt ! -name *~.txt


Question 5:
Copy all files in the $HOME/1123 directory, that end in ".txt", and omit files containing a tilde "~" character, to directory $HOME/CUT.

Use only the find and cp commands. You will need to utilize the -exec option on find to accomplish this activity.

The find command uses BOOLEAN "!" to designate that it does not want to find any files or directories that follows.

ANSWER:
find $HOME/1123 -name *.txt ! -name *~.txt -exec cp {} $HOME/1123 $HOME/CUT \;


Question 6:
Using ONLY the find command, find all empty files/directories in directory /var and 
print out ONLY the filename (not absolute path), and the inode number, separated by newlines.

Tip: When using the man pages, it is better to focus your search then to visually scan 1000+ lines of text. 
Combining the output with the grep command, possibly with its -A, -B, or -C options, can help drive context driven searches of those manual pages.

Example Output

123 file1
456 file2
789 file3


ANSWER:
find /var -empty -printf "%i %f\n"

Question 7:
Using only the ls -l and cut Commands, write a BASH script that shows all filenames with extensions ie: 1.txt, etc., but no directories, in $HOME/CUT.
    Write those to a text file called names in $HOME/CUT directory.
    Omit the names filename from your output.

NOTE: The output should only be the file names with no additional information. Additionally, your code will be executed twice. T
his is to ensure you have taken into account how file redirection and command execution works.

To read more on Simple Command Expansion, go to the following resource:

    https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Simple-Command-Expansion


ANSWER:
ls -p $HOME/CUT | grep -v '/$' | grep -v 'names' > $HOME/CUT/names


Question 8:
Using ONLY the find command, find all files on the system with inode 4026532575 and print only the filename to the screen, not the absolute path to the file, separating each filename with a newline. 
Ensure unneeded output is not visible.

Tip: The above inode is specific to this CTFd question and might not be in use on your Linux Opstation. 
Instead, you can test your command on your Linux OpStation against inode 999.

ANSWER:
find / -inum 4026532575 -printf "%f\n"


Question 9:
Write a basic bash script that greps ONLY the IP addresses in the text file provided (named StoryHiddenIPs in the current directory); sort them uniquely by number of times they appear.

It is not important to have a regular expression that only catches fully valid IP addresses. It is more important that you become familiar with creating and using regular expressions. Below, there are some useful websites that you can use to visually see what your regular expression pattern is matching on.

    www.regexr.com
    www.regex101.com

E.g., [1-4]{0,5}

Bracket Expression: [1-4] = 1 or 2 or 3 or 4

Repetitions: {0,5} = above numbers (1,2,3,4) appear from 0 to 5 times, meaning our number can be between 1 and 44444

Interpreted BASH Chars: . | $ ` \ ! must be escaped with \ in a regex. I.E. to match on a backslash, you must use \\ in your pattern.

Note: The basics of regular expressions are assumed knowledge for this module, and you will need to call back to prior learning. If you are in need of a quick refresher, the following man pages could be useful.

    man egrep
    man regex.7


ANSWER: 
grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' StoryHiddenIPs | sort -n | uniq -c | sort -r


Question 10: 

    Using ONLY the awk command, write a BASH one-liner script that extracts ONLY the names of all the system and user accounts that are not UIDs 0-3.
    Only display those that use /bin/bash as their default shell.
    The input file is named $HOME/passwd and is located in the current directory.
    Output the results to a file called $HOME/SED/names.txt

Tip: awk can use conditional statements, e.g. print only the line in /etc/passwd that has "root" as its first field.

awk -F: '($1 == "root") {print $0}' /etc/passwd


Answer:
cat $HOME/passwd | awk -F: '($3 > 3 && $7 == "/bin/bash"){print $1}' > $HOME/SED/names.txt


QUESTION 11:

    Write a Bash script using "Command Substitution" to replace all passwords, using openssl, from the file $HOME/PASS/shadow.txt with the MD5 encrypted password: Password1234, with salt: bad4u
    Output of this command should go to the screen/standard output.
    You are not limited to a particular command, however you must use openssl. Type man openssl passwd for more information.

TIP: While not required, using awk is possibly the most straightforward method of accomplishing this activity. Keep in mind that awk is its own programming language. 
It can not use Bash variables unless you import them in. Below is a break down of applicable parts of an awk command, with descriptions of each part. 
See if you can use this example as a jumping off point to accomplish the end state of the activity.

#!/bin/bash 

a=”New name to place in field one” 
awk -F: -v "awk_var=$a" 'BEGIN {OFS=":"} {$1=awk_var} {print $1,$NF}' /etc/passwd

# '-F' is used to change the default field seperator of " ".  In this example, it   \
# now designates ':'

# '-v' designates or imports a variable into AWK.  In the above example, 'awk_var' is   \
# declared with the Bash variable of '$a'.

# The 'BEGIN' pattern(s) tells AWK to execute action parts of the pattern before any of \
# the input is read.  In this case, the 'OFS', or 'Output Field Seperator' will place   \
# colons between the firelds being printed in the output.  As well, it will replace the \
# first field (i.e. '$1') with whatever data is contained in the AWK variable declared  \
# previously.

# The '{print}' statement designates whatever the desired fields are to print.  '$0' is \
# the variable for the entire line.  The first field is '$1', the second field is '$2', \
# and so on.  AWK has a builtin variable, '$NF' which evaluates to the number of fields \
# on a line.  Use this as a shortcut if you need to print the last field on the line.

a=$(openssl passwd -1 -salt bad4u Password1234) 
awk -F: -v "var=$a" 'BEGIN {OFS=":"} {$2=var} {print $0}' $HOME/PASS/shadow.txt


Question 12:

    Using ONLY sed, write all lines from $HOME/passwd into $HOME/PASS/passwd.txt that do not end with either /bin/sh or /bin/false.

TIP: When designating a path in a sed command, you must escape the path characters if they are to be interpreted as part of the string

sed '/\/bin/d' file.txt



Answer:
sed -e '/\/bin\/sh/d' -e '/\/bin\/false/d' $HOME/passwd>  $HOME/PASS/passwd.txt


QUESTION 13:

    Using find, find all files under the $HOME directory with a .bin extension ONLY.
    Once the file(s) and their path(s) have been found, remove the file name from the absolute path output.
    Ensure there is no trailing / at the end of the directory path when outputting to standard output.
    You may need to sort the output depending on the command(s) you use. Have each path displayed only once.

Tip: For stripping the filename out of the output, there are different ways that this can be accomplished based on what you have learned so far.

    Utilizing -printf options on find.
    Utilizing awk to manipulate the fields. This may leave the trailing / if you don't take that into account.
    Utilizing the rev and cut commands creatively.


Answer: 
find $HOME -type f -iname "*.bin" 2>/dev/null | rev | cut -d/ -f2- | rev | sort -u



QUESTION 14:
Write a script that will do the following.

    Write a script which will copy the last entry/line in the passwd-like file specified by the $1 positional parameter
    Modify the copied line to change:
        User name to the value specified by $2 positional parameter
        Used id and group id to the value specified by $3 positional parameter
        Home directory to a directory matching the user name specified by $2 positional parameter under the /home directory (i.e. if the $2 was 'Chris', the new line would have /home/Chris as its home directory)
        The default shell to `/bin/bash'
    Append the modified line to the end of the file

Example INPUT file's last line.

games:x:5:60::/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin

If positional parameter 2 was passed "devildog" and positional paramter 3 was passed "9001", after modifications the appended line would look like this.

devildog:x:9001:9001::/home/devildog:/bin/bash

QUESTION 15:

    Find all executable files under the following four directories:
        /bin
        /sbin
        /usr/bin
        /usr/sbin
    Sort the filenames with absolute path, and get the md5sum of the 10th file from the top of the list.

Tip: In the below example, you can see the different uses of md5sum. While not wrong, the first command is hashing the string output of the the find command. In the second, md5sum is hashing the file contents of the given file, which is what is intended for this activity. You can also tell the second method hashed the file as the file name is listed in the hash output; the first only lists a hyphen indicating a string was hashed. For this activity, to provide md5sum with the 10th file of the sorted output, it is recommended to use Command Subtitution.

[chris@localhost ~]$ find /etc -maxdepth 1 -name passwd | md5sum
9231fb35b4431d59eae53a8c0d673231  -
[chris@localhost ~]$ md5sum /etc/passwd
62f5fa5100adcee3305cf979b5734a3e  /etc/passwd


ANSWER:
A=$(find /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin -executable -type f| sort |head -10 | tail -1)
md5sum $A | cut -d' ' -f1


QUESTION 16:

    Write a script which will find and hash the contents 3 levels deep from each of these directories: /bin /etc /var
    Your script should:
        Exclude file type named pipes. These can break your script.
        Redirect STDOUT and STDERR to separate files.
        Determine the count of files hashed in the file with hashes.
        Determine the count of unsuccessfully hashed directories.
        Have both counts output to the screen with an appropriate title for each count.

Example Output:

Successfully Hashed Files: 105
Unsuccessfully Hashed Directories: 23


ANSWER:
dirs=' /bin /etc/ var'
find $dirs -maxdepth 3! -type p -exec md5sum {} \; > STDOUT.txt 2>STDERR.txt
good=$(cat STDOUT.txt |wc -l)
bad=$(egrep "Is a" STDERR.txt | wc -l)
echo "Successfully Hashed Files: $good"
echo "Unsuccessfully Hashed Directories: $bad"


A=$(find /bin /etc /var -maxdepth 3 ! -type p -exec md5sum {}\; > $HOME/goodhash 2>$HOME/badhash)
B=$(cat $HOME/badhash | grep -v "Permission denied" | wc -l)
C=$(cat $HOME/goodhash | wc -l)
echo "Successfully Hashed Files:" $C
echo "Unsuccessfully Hashed Directories:" $B

Big Mike Got Killed In Russia 1 (SysV)

    BIOS -Basic Input Output System

    MBR -Master Boot Record

    GRUB -Grand Unified Bootloader

    Kernel

    Init (SysV or SystemD)

    Runlevels


    The machine’s BIOS or boot firmware loads and runs a boot loader.

    The boot loader(“Grub” located in MBR) finds the kernel image on disk, loads it into memory, and starts it.

    The kernel initializes the devices and its drivers.

    The kernel mounts the root filesystem.

    The kernel starts a program called init with a process ID of 1. This point is the user space start.

    Init sets the rest of the system processes in motion via pre-configured runlevels.

Big Mike Got Killed In Russia (SysV)

    BIOS

        First program to run on startup (Flash or ROM)

            If stored in flash memory → becomes a target for BIOS Rootkits

        Performs POST - Power On Self Test

        Performs system integrity checks

        Builds a device tree (mice, keyboard, hard drive, video cards, etc..)

        Reads and executes the first sector on the boot disk (MBR) to load bootloader to memory
    

MBR - Master Boot Record

        Located at the very beginning of the bootable disk (512 bytes) and contains the primary bootloader, partition table and MBR validity check

        Contains code for GRUB - Grand Unified Boot Loader

        (Note: Could also contain LILO - Linux Loader)

MBR

    First 512 bytes of the HD

    Hard disks utilizing a MBR can have a maximum of 4 primary partitions and a max size of 2 TB each.

        Typically the MBR is located on /dev/hda or /dev/sda (/dev/vda)

        It contains information about GRUB (or LILO or other Boot Loader system)

    Other related commands:

        du - disk usage: summarize disk usage of the set of FILEs

        df - disk free : displays the amount of disk space available on the file system

        lsblk - lists information about all available - or specified - block devices


    GRUB - Grand Unified Bootloader

        Dynamically configurable with the capability to make changes during boot

            Config File - /boot/grub/menu.lst

            Altering boot entries, selecting different kernels, and modifying the initial RAM disk (initrd)

        OS Selection screen where if no choice is made, default kernel specified in the grub configuration file

        Bootloader (GRUB) passes text based kernel parameters (Ex. root=UUID=70cc6e89…,ro, splash). If not recognized, the option will be passed to init (i.e. ‘-s’ for single-user mode)

        Kernel options are sometimes configurable at the menu with the ‘e’ key

    Kernel

        Uncompresses itself into RAM

        Establishes memory management, detects CPU type, page tables

        Mounts the root ‘/ ’ filesystem

        kernel is process 0 [kthreadd]

        Executes /sbin/init or systemd daemon, the very first process started by the kernel with a process ID (PID) of 1

        ‘ls -l /sbin/init’ to determine which Init system you are using



    Configures the environment for the system

        Looks at the /etc/inittab

        Available run levels 0 - 6

        Identifies the default 'init' run level from /etc/inittab and uses that to load all the appropriate programs

        The entire startup process is handled by scripts

            /etc/init.d/

            Scripts that run ‘S’tart and ‘K’ill scripts out of applicable rc folders

        'service <service name> start | stop | restart | status | reload | …​''

        ‘service --status-all’

    inittab line descriptions (rc = run commands)

        All lines in inittab take the following form, with four fields separated by colons in this order:

            A unique identifier (a short string, such as id in the previous example)

            The applicable runlevel number(s)

            The action that init should take (default runlevel to 5 in the previous example)



    Loads system in parallel and from binaries (faster and more secure)

    Instead of runlevels, uses 'targets' that point to other dependencies based on the features of the environment desired

        ‘default.target’ is essentially the default runlevel (equivalent to id:5:initdefault in /etc/inittab). Use ‘systemctl get-default’ to find it, and ‘systemctl set-default’ to change it.

    ‘systemctl list-dependencies’ shows all the services running under default.target

    Uses 'systemctl’ to manage system (backwards compatible)

        ‘systemctl status <application>.service’

        ‘systemctl list-units’

    Config: /etc/systemd/ and /etc/systemd/system



    /lib/systemd/system 'ls -l | grep -v wants | grep run’

        runlevel0.target - > poweroff.target

        runlevel1.target - > rescue.target

        runlevel2.target - > multi-user.target

        runlevel3.target - > multi-user.target

        runlevel4.target - > multi-user.target

        runlevel5.target - > graphical.target

        runlevel6.target - > reboot.target


    A runlevel is a software configuration where only a select group of processes exist

        0 - halt (Do NOT set initdefault to this)

        1 - Single user mode (switched from multi-user)

        2 - Multiuser, without networking

        3 - Full multiuser mode, with networking

        4 - unused

        5 - X11 (GUI)

        6 - reboot (Do NOT set initdefault to this)

    ‘ls -l /etc/rc<1-6>.d’ to see different services run in each runlevel

        If running something other than an init.d service, then probably malicious

Partitions

    BLOCK DEVICE (Physical or Virtual) >> Partition Table >> Logical Partition >> Filesystem (ext3,ext4,FAT)

    Hard disks, USBs, SD cards, or anything with storage space must have at least one partition in order to be used

    Multiple partitions can exist on a single storage device, and you can format each partition with a different file system

    A partition is the logical segmentation of a single storage device into multiple usable sections

    Two main types of HD Partitioning:

        MBR - Master Boot Record

        GPT - GUID (Globally Unique Identifiers) Partition Table

    There are two primary processes after startup:

        For kernel-space processes [kthreadd] ( PID = 2 )

        For user-space processes /sbin/init ( PID = 1 )

    All kernel processes are fork()ed from [kthreadd] and all user processes are fork()ed from /sbin/init or direct ancestor.

    Kernel processes are typically used to manage hardware, are directly handled by the kernel,have their own memory space, and have a high priority.

    They can be identified by the name enclosed in square brackets [] (using the -f option with ps). kthreadd spawned processes will have a PPID of 2.

    The kernel starts /sbin/init which is the parent/grandparent of all user processes.
Kernel vs User Space

    The kernel processes run in its own memory space. User processes run in a separate memory space. Code running in kernel mode has unrestricted access to the processor and main memory. This is a powerful but dangerous privilege that allows a kernel process to easily crash the entire system. The area that only the kernel can access is called kernel space.

    User mode, in comparison, restricts access to a (usually quite small) subset of memory and safe CPU operations. User space refers to the parts of main memory that the user processes can access. If a process makes a mistake and crashes, the consequences are limited and can be cleaned up by the kernel. This means that if your web browser crashes, it won’t take down

Process Ownership, EUID, RUID

    The effective user ID (euid), defines the access rights for a process. A second user ID, the real user ID (ruid), indicates who initiated a process.

    The real user ID defines the user that can interact with the running process—most significantly, which user can kill and send signals to a process.

    Users can only modify / interact with files /process that they own or have been shared with them.

    A user is an entity that can run processes and own files. Users exist primarily to support permissions and boundaries. Every user-space process has a user owner, and processes are said to run as the owner. A user may terminate or modify the behavior of its own processes (within certain limits), but it cannot interfere with other users’ processes. In addition, users may own files and choose whether they share them with other users.

System Calls

    A system call is an interaction between a process and the kernel.

    Two system calls, fork() and exec(), are important to understanding how processes startup:

        fork() When a process calls fork(), the kernel creates a nearly identical copy of the process.

        exec() When a process calls exec(program), the kernel starts program, replacing the current process.

Orphan and Zombie (defunct) Processes

    Orphan - Parent process exited, adopted by sbin/init with PPID of 1.

        All daemons are orphans

        disown -a && exit # Close a shell/terminal and force all children to be adopted

    Zombie (defunct) - completed process, but still has an entry in the process table, waiting on parent to acknowledge or terminate.

        Zombie can’t be terminated with kill since it has already finished execution, unless the parent process that spawned it is killed.

        Do not use resources, but do take up an entry of the process table which is a finite resource

    Fork Bomb - denial-of-service attack wherein a process continually replicates itself to deplete available system resources,

        Remedy - ‘ulimit -u 30’ sets the max processes a user can run at 30

Demonstrations 2

    orphan.sh

    zombie.sh

Daemons (Services)

    Program that runs as a background process (Ex. syslogd, sshd, cron)

    All daemons are Orphans, but all orphans are not Daemons

    A daemons purpose is to manage/monitor a service: {status, start, restart}

    ‘man cron’ - to see an example of a daemon that starts during the boot process

    Persistence - Daemons are service that should run for duration of system operation, since init is parent, would require shutdown for parent to die.

    Malicious processes are sometimes orphaned and named to make it look like a daemon process ‘ps --ppid 1 -lf’

ps -elf
ps -elf --ppid

Jobs Control

    ‘jobs’ - Display List of Jobs running in the background

    ‘fg’ or ‘bg’ - Push / Pull jobs to / from the foreground / background

    ‘kill %<job number>’ - Terminate the process by job number

    ‘[ctrl -z]’ or ‘kill -19’ - stop / suspend the job

    ‘kill -9 <PID>’ or ‘pkill -9 <process name>’

        Stop Process = SIGSTOP(19) (pause signal, let’s you continue later, does not kill process)

        End Process = SIGTERM(15) (termination signal, the right way, the application can intercept this signal and initiate shutdown tasks such as temp file cleanup)

        Kill Process = SIGKILL(9) (kill signal, extreme, only use if SIGTERM doesn’t work, won’t initiate shutdown tasks)

Cron Jobs

    cron daemon checks the directories /var/spool/cron, /etc/cron.d and the file /etc/crontab, once a minute and executes any commands specified that match the time.

    Two types of cron jobs

        System cron jobs

            run as root and rigidly scheduled

            perform system-wide maintenance tasks (Cleaning out /tmp or rotating logs)

            controlled by /etc/crontab

        User cron jobs

            Use 'crontab’ command to create user cron jobs

            stored in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/
Cron Jobs (Continued)

    ‘crontab -u [user] file’ - sets users crontab file to the contents of listed file

    ‘crontab -l -u [user]’ - Displays user’s crontab contents

    ‘crontab -r -u [user]’ - Removes user’s crontab contents

    ‘crontab -e -u [user]’ - edits user’s crontab contents

    crontab jobs run with the permissions of the owner of the crontab file

Windows Auditing


Outcome

    Cover the startup process of the SRM.

    Cover the categories of the event log.

    Demonstrate configuring audit policies.

Windows Event Log

    What is the functionality of the main logs?

        At startup (or on config changes), LSASS sends the system audit policy to the Security Reference Monitor (SRM).

        When an object is accessed, SRM generates auditing messages and sends them to LSASS.

        LSASS sends the event log messages on to the Event Logger.

Windows Event Log

Application - Contains events logged by applications.

Security - Contains events such as valid/ invalid logon attempts and other events related to resource use like creating, opening, or deleting files.

System - Contains events logged by system components, such as driver failures other system component to load during startup.

CustomLog - Contains events logged by applications that create a custom log.
Using a custom log enables an application to control the size of the log or attach ACLs for security purposes without affecting other applications.

Script Block Logging

    Logs detailed processing of commands, script blocks, functions, and scripts to the Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational event log.

    Logging is enabled through the Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging Group Policy setting in

        Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Windows PowerShell

    Turn on script black logging via the Registry

        reg.exe add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScriptBlockLogging\ /v EnableScriptBlockLogging /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

    Authentication

        /var/log/auth.log - Authentication related events

        /var/run/utmp - Users currently logged in

        /var/log/wtmp - History file for utmp

        /var/log/btmp - Failed login attempts

    Application

        apache - Web Server (dir)

        apt - Package Manager (dir)

        /var/log/mysql.log


    System

        /var/log/messages - Legacy Catch all

        /var/log/syslog - Ubuntu/Debian Catch all

        dmesg = Device Messenger (queires /proc/kmsg)

            Kernel Ring Buffer - Never fills

            First logs generated by the system

    Location : /var/log

    Config File : /etc/rsyslog.conf

    Service : /usr/sbin/rsyslogd

LOGGING Daemon

    /usr/sbin/rsyslogd

        User space daemon - Reads messages written to /dev/log and formats and stores them based on /etc/rsyslog.conf rules.

            syslog() via libc

            kernel ring buffer

            audit records via audit subsystem (auditd)

Config file

    /etc/rsyslog.conf

        Log entries follow syslog standard facility.severity

        facility = what program, or part of system, log is from

        severity = urgency
Facility Codes

0   kernel messages
1   user-level messages
2   mail system
3   system daemons
4   security/authorization messages
5   messages generated internally by syslogd
6   line printer subsystem
7   network news subsystem
8   UUCP subsystem
9   clock daemon
10  security/authorization messages
11  FTP daemon
12  NTP subsystem13|log audit
...TRIMMED

Severity Codes

0  emerg, panic:  Emergency: system is unusable
1  alert:         Action must be taken immediately
2  crit:          Critical conditions
3  err, error:    Error conditions
4  warn, warning: Warning conditions
5  notice:        Normal but significant condition
6  info:          Informational messages
7  Debug:         Debug-level messages

Log Enumeration / Management

    Best Practices

        Meaningful Naming Schema

        Separate logs logically and by precedence

        Sync time across network

        Control log access

    Utilize cron jobs / scripts

        logrotate

            /etc/logrotate.conf

            How large to let files get. How long to keep them.

Useful Logging Commands

    tail -f - Continuously show end of file

    less /var/log/syslog - View Log in page viewer

    logger - Send a user generated message to system Log i.e. Starting Update

    > /var/log/messages - Wipes Logs

        Why do this as opposed to deleting/recreating files?

    last -f /var/log{wtmp,btmp} - Needed to view data files

Auditing vs Logging

    Logging is system/application defined

    Auditing is user defined

    [kauditd] - runs at the kernel level and can monitor individual syscalls (/sbin/auditd)

    auditctl - control/config command

    aureport - summary reports of audit logs

    ausearch - query audit logs

cat /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf



/var/run/utmp -currently logged on
/var/log/auth.log = authorization info login failed login
var/log/secure = sec logs, failed login, priv stuff
var/run/utmp = user crrently logged in 
var/log/wtmp = archive of  utmp
var/log/btmp = failed login attempts
/sbin/rsyslog.d


for system.d systems use journalctl
journalctl --list -boot
journalctl -u ssh.service
sudo !!
